# DebateBase

Due to the impromptu nature of American parliamentary debate (APD), existing resources for APD debaters are scarce, limiting opportunities for debaters who cannot afford external coaching and exacerbating education inequality ([Guide to APDA & FAQs, 2023](https://apda.online/about/guide-to-apda/)). Utilizing generative AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 may increase access to these resources ([Martindale, 2023](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/gpt-4-vs-gpt-35/)). However, current generative AI models are limited by the absence of domain knowledge necessary to answer domain-specific questions (Noy & Zhang, 2023). To improve the quality of accessible educational AI, a custom AI knowledge database was developed to investigate the accuracy of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4’s responses to APD-related queries of varying query specificity and domain knowledge dependency. Results reveal that both models’ performance significantly improved once the models were provided with contextual information from the database. This application emphasizes the pressing need for technological tools in combating education inequality. Further research will continue to explore the implications of employing generative AI tools in the classroom ([Zhang & Aslan, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2021.100025)).
